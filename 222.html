			<p style="position: absolute; top:37%; left:25%; text-align: justify; margin-right:20px;">
			The Gods' Council assembles once every millennium to decide the fate of humanity, deciding that mankind's 7 million years of irredeemable
			history gives justification for their extinction. But the valkyrie Brunhilde proposes giving humanity one last chance to prove their worth
			and the gods agree to hold the tournament of Ragnarök, where humanity will be spared if they can best the gods in seven out of thirteen matches.
			Humanity's representatives are the Einherjar, notable humans across history who are each granted a valkyrie who becomes a powerful weapon tailored
			for their user's combat style called "Volund", at the risk of losing her life if the user is killed.</p>
			
			<p style="position: absolute; top:55%; left:25%; text-align: justify; margin-right:20px;">
		Every 1000 years, gods of every pantheon convene and hold a conference to decide the fate of humanity by calling a vote to
		determine whether or not the human race should continue living or go extinct. With the most recent of these conferences having
		concluded, the gods unanimously decided to put humanity to an end. However, at the very last second, the eldest of the Valkyries,
		accompanied by the youngest, intervened and made the bold proposition to let humanity have a say in their fate by letting them go
		against the gods in a series of one-on-one fights to see if they are worthy of continuing to exist. Afraid to let go of their
		pride, the gods accept this proposal. Thirteen gods will fight against thirteen human champions. The first side to reach seven
		victories will decide humanity's fate.
